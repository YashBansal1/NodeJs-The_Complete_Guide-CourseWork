# Introduction

Nodejs is built on top of the javascript that allows us to use many features of javascript add some addition feature to it and able to run it on server outside the browser.
Google V8 is javascript engine that run the javascript in our browser. Javascript engine takes the machine code and convert it to machine code. V8 is written in c++;

Nodejs take the V8 engine and add various features like reading files, editing files which are not possible in the browser. Nodejs doesn't run in the browser. Nodejs uses V8 to run our javascript scripts but these don't run in the browser but are directly executed through that nodejs runtime.

JavaScript on Sever -
Our server has Database, Authentication, Input Validation, Business Logic.
We are not limited to the server for Node.js as it is a Javascript Runtime. We can use it for more than just server-side code. Ex - Utility Scripts, Build Tools etc.

Node.js main role is in web development. We can not only write the code that is running on the server we can also write the server ourselves. So that our code listen for the incoming requests and routes them to our other code. And return the response to those requests.

Running Node.js code -

1. Using REPL (Read User Input, Evaluate the input, Print the Output, Loop) - It is great playground, execute the code as we write it. Not great for writing real applications.
2. Execute files
